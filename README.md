# Tenzies

Based on the logic and design of the dice game from the "Learn React for free" course I completed on the Scrimba.com platform, I wrote locally my own version of the game using TypeScript. I added a moves counter to the project.

App uses confetti library for visual effect of winning the game and nanoid to generate random keys for children components.
